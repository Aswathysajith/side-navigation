                <p> 
                    C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming
.

Our C++ tutorial includes all topics of C++ such as first example, control statements, objects and classes, inheritance
, constructor
, destructor, this, static, polymorphism, abstraction, abstract class, interface, namespace, encapsulation, arrays, strings, exception handling, File IO, etc.

<br> <br> What is C++ <br><br>
C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports 
object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

                <p>
                    In C++, Object is a real world entity, for example, chair, car, pen, mobile, laptop etc.

In other words, object is an entity that has state and behavior. Here, state means data and behavior means functionality.

Object is a runtime entity, it is created at runtime.
Object is an instance of a class. All the members of the class can be accessed through object.

Let's see an example to create object of student class using s1 as the reference variable.

<br><br>  Student s1;  //creating an object of Student      
In this example, Student is the type and s1 is the reference variable that refers to the instance of Student class.

                <p>C++ Class
                    In C++, class is a group of similar objects. It is a template from which objects are created. It can have fields, methods, constructors etc.
                    
                    Let's see an example of C++ class that has three fields only.<br><br>
                    
                    class Student    <br>
                     {    
                         public: <br> 
                         int id;  //field or data member  <br>   
                         float salary; //field or data member  <br>
                         String name;//field or data member   <br> 
                     }    </p>
             </section>
             <section class="main-section" id="abs">
                <header> Abstraction</header>
                <p>
                    Data abstraction allows a program to ignore the details of how a data type is represented. Abstraction (derived from a Latin word abs, meaning away from and trahere, meaning to draw) refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanations. C++ classes use the technique of abstraction and are defined as a list of abstract attributes such as width, cost, size etc and functions to operate on these attributes. They put in a nutshell all the essential properties of an object that are required to be created. The attributes are therefore called data members as they hold information. The functions that operate on those data members are termed as member functions. Since C++ classes use the data abstraction concept, they are also termed as abstract data types.
